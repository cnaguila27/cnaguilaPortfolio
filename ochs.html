				<h1> The Sponsor: OC Head Start </h1>
				<p id="contentP"> Our sponsor is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving at-risk families in Orange County. Their purpose is to provide
					these families support, by enrolling kids in head start programs and empowering the parents by providing them tools
					to ensure the success of their children.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="contentContainer">
				<image class="img-responsive" id="dividerImage" src="divider.png">
				<h1> The Problem </h1>
				<p id="contentP"> The application process for the program acts like a black-box; parents could not see their application status or 
					know which document forms they needed to submit. As a result, the centers would be flooded with calls and staff 
					members often had to work long hours to update applications manually. In addition, our sponsor informed us that 
					some of the families were having difficulty finding OC Head Start offices to submit their paperwork to. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="contentContainer">
				<image class="img-responsive" id="dividerImage" src="divider.png">
				<h1> Our Solution </h1>
				<p id="contentP"> To create a website which informs parents of their current application status. This would allow parents to know
					which forms they have submitted, as well as any other form they may be missing. In addition, we wanted to display 
					a map in the website, in which parents could look up which center is closest
					to their current location. </p>

				<h1> The Process </h1>
				<div id="cardContainer">
					<h2> Requirements Elicitation </h2>
					<p id="contentP"> As a team, we regularly met with our sponsor to gather requirements necessary for the construction of our website. 
						Because we were tasked to simulate an Agile environment, this made it easy to have room for flexibility in the requirements. 
						I was in charge of creating and overseeing the development of the System Requirements Document. I decided to use the IEEE 830-1998 
						template since it met our needs and fit well with the context of the project. </p>

				<h2> Explanation </h2>
				<p id="contentP"> Incremental design of our high-fidelity prototype. The styles changed as we gathered
					more information from our sponsor, so that it reflected the mission of the website. I was in charge of adding functionality
					to the pages by using PHP and MySQL. I was also in charge of developing the document display where parents can see what documents 
					they are missing. This information was extracted using SQL queries from the database our team developed. </p>

				<h1> Final Product </h1>
				<p id="contentP"> Although we faced some limitations due to government regulations on non-profit organizations, we were able to create 
					something that followed their rules and that could potentially resolve the influx of calls.  </p>
