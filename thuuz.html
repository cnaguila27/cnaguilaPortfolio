			<h1> Overview </h1>
			<p> As a part of a project course, we were tasked to redesign an existing application, Thuuz Sports, 
			through the use of Human-Computer Interaction principles. The emphasis was to improve 
			the way in which users were experiencing the application and to justify our redesigns 
				based on evidence-based design. </p>
			
			
			<h1> The App: Thuuz Sports </h1>
			<p>
			Thuuz is a mobile sports application that provides its users with game statistics and highlights of their favorite sports. 
			However, the app differentiantes itself from its competitors with an unique algorithm that determines the excitement of 
			games and ranks them based on a numerical scale from 0-100. Although it is a promising feature, 
			it is unfortunately masked by the various usability issues found through user research our team conducted. </p>

			
			<h1> Usability Issues </h1>
			
			<h3> Information overload </h3>
			<p> Users were overwhelmed and confused with the amount of information being presented. For example,
				 too many games were being displayed in the home page. Information was not paraphrased in the game previews. </p> 
			
			<img class="img-responsive" src="InformationOverload2.jpg" alt="content image">
				 
				 
			<h3 class="borderHeader"> Bad use of fonts & color </h3>
			<p> Users had a hard time with the representation of buttons and fonts, which led users to be unable 
				 to find buttons for the actions they were looking for. For example, it is hard to see the "No, maybe later" option
				 because it is in a small font, the font color does not contrast with the background, and it is placed at the bottom
				 of the screen. </p> 
			
			<img class="img-responsive" src="BadUse.jpg" alt="content image">
			
				 
				 
			<h3 class="borderHeader"> Counter-intuitive navigation </h3>
			<p> The navigation of the application has several aspects that are counter-intuitive and do not follow industry standards, 
				 which caused confusion in our users. For example, the user had no indication they could swipe left or right on the 
				 homepage to navigate to future game dates, since the indicators at the bottom of the page are hard to see. Our users pointed out that 
				 the labels for the dates were displayed in inconsistent formats. Also, they were unsure where buttons like "My Sports" and "check in" would lead
				 them to.</p> 
				 
			<img class="img-responsive" src="CounterIntuitive.jpg" alt="content image">
				 
				 
			<h3 class="borderHeader"> Confusion of Excitement Score </h3>
			<p> Users did not find the excitement score easily and questioned the purpose of it. This is significant because 
				 the excitement score is the feature that sets it apart from other competitors, yet it is muddled by all the present 
				 usability issues. Furthermore, our users could not find additional information in the game page that explained the
				 match's current excitement score. </p>

			<img class="img-responsive" src="Thuuzafter2.png" alt="content image">
			
			<p> As a way to alleviate some of these issues, we came up with the following redesign goals: </p>
			
			<!-- list with description w3 cite -->
			
			<h3> Present the right information </h3>
			<p> The original design crowded too much information within the homepage. Our new design separates and prioritizes information 
				 as seen in Figure 2. This allows users to find what they're looking for almost immediately. In addition, we added an universal 
				 search functionality, which also allows users to make searches and a filter option in which they can choose what information 
				 they want to see on their feed.</p>
			
			<h3> Visual consistency of elements </h3>
			<p> In all of the above figures, we used universal titles that are recognizable to users, and we adhered to standard iOS design 
				 guidelines for placement of buttons.</p>
			
			<h3> Make navigation clear & simple </h3>
			<p> As seen in Figure 2, we created a vertical pop-up menu which the user can access at all times by clicking the T bubble at 
				 the bottom right corner.</p>
			
			<h3> Emphasize excitemet score </h3>
			<p> As seen in Figure 4, we created a chart that improves the display of the excitement score calculated throughout the game. 
				 Users would now be able to better understand the score and how it fits with the game they are watching.</p>
		
			
			<h1> Inspiration and Motivations </h1>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="Inspiration.png" alt="content image">
			 <p> We adhered to Nielsen's Heuristics when designing the new interface and took inspiration from the following 
			    applications: Tumblr, and the App Store (iOS). Tumblr has a quick and easy-to-use, pop-up navigation for posting content which users can access any time. 
				The App Store displays its content through the use of card-like tiles which present information in a clear and minimal way. </p>
